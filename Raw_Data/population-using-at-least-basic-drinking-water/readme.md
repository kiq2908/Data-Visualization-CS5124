# Share of population using at least a basic drinking water source - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["Share of population using at least a basic drinking water source"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-using-at-least-basic-drinking-water?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=false) on the Our World in Data website. It was downloaded on February 19, 2026.

### Active Filters

A filtered subset of the full data was downloaded. The following filters were applied:

## CSV Structure

The high level structure of the CSV file is that each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) and a timepoint (usually a year).

The first two columns in the CSV file are "Entity" and "Code". "Entity" is the name of the entity (e.g. "United States"). "Code" is the OWID internal entity code that we use if the entity is a country or region. For most countries, this is the same as the [iso alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code of the entity (e.g. "USA") - for non-standard countries like historical countries these are custom codes.

The third column is either "Year" or "Day". If the data is annual, this is "Year" and contains only the year as an integer. If the column is "Day", the column contains a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The final column is the data column, which is the time series that powers the chart. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "full data" option, then the column corresponds to the time series below. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "only selected data visible in the chart" option then the data column is transformed depending on the chart type and thus the association with the time series might not be as straightforward.


## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc.. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc..

## About the data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stich together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

## Detailed information about the data


## Share of the population using at least a basic drinking water source
Proportion of people who use an [improved drinking water source](#dod:improved-water-source), which is either located on their premises, or at a collection point, which takes no more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip.

### What you should know about this data
* Easy and reliable access to drinking water is fundamental to human health and well-being. Improved drinking water sources reduce the risk of contamination and the spread of waterborne diseases.
* Having access to water on premises and when needed reduces the time and effort spent collecting water, which frees up time for education, work and participation in community life.
* Basic drinking water services are defined as an [improved drinking water source](#dod:improved-water-source), provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing.
* Improved drinking water sources are those that have the potential to deliver safe water by nature of their design and construction, and include: piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water.
* This data is provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). They compile data from nationally representative household surveys and censuses, administrative data and service provider data. To learn more, see the [JMP Methodology](https://washdata.org/topics/methods/data-sources).
* This data reflects actual service use, which is directly linked to health outcomes and can be consistently measured across countries using household surveys. It is possible to theoretically have access to some kind of water and sanitation infrastructure, but not use them for daily needs. Therefore we refer to "use" or "using" rather than "access" to better reflect the underlying data.

### How is this data described by its producer - WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (2025)?
Use of improved drinking water sources no more than 30 mins roundtrip, inclusive of safely managed.
