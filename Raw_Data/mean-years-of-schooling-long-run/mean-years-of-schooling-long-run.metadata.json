        "For the years leading up to 2015, the data are derived from historical estimates, providing a retrospective view of education levels. For the years 2015 and beyond, the projections are grounded in the historical data of 2010, which serve as the foundational benchmark. These forward-looking projections are then crafted by analyzing trends in school enrollment and changes in population structures. These trends are informed by forecasts from the United Nations, ensuring a global perspective and understanding of future educational developments.",
        "The method to estimate average years of schooling takes into account the age distribution in the population. This is important because access to education can vary significantly across generations. Older generations may have had fewer educational opportunities than younger ones, which affects the overall average education level.",
        "It also considers the typical duration required to complete each education level. For instance, primary education usually takes about 6 years, secondary education 4-6 years, and higher education may take even longer. Understanding the time investment required for different education levels is essential for accurate assessment.",
        "At its core, the method calculates the average years of schooling. This is achieved by determining the percentage of the population that has completed each education level and multiplying it by the duration of that level. The sum of these results gives a comprehensive view of both the extent of educational attainment and the time spent in education by the population.",
        "The method is dynamic, adapting to changes over time and across regions. For example, if a country increases the length of primary education, this change is included in subsequent calculations. This adaptability ensures that the average years of education remain relevant and accurate over time and across different educational systems.",
        "Note that the method does not take into account the quality of education. It only considers the number of years spent in education. This means that the average years of schooling may not reflect the actual skills and knowledge of the population."
